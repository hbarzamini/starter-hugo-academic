I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Northern Illinois University. My research focus is on the fields of Requirements Engineering for ML-based software components. Currently, I am working on specifying Non-Functional Requirements (NFR), such as re-usability, robustness, and safety, for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled software systems, such as pedestrian detectors in the automotive domain.
